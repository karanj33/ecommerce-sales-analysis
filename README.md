# ecommerce-sales-analysis

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard built to analyze sales and profit trends from an e-commerce dataset.
It reflects my hands-on learning in data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python, Pandas, Excel, and Power BI.

📌 Project Objective

To explore key business metrics such as total sales, profit, product performance, and regional trends.
The goal was to clean raw data, understand patterns, and present insights through an interactive dashboard.

🛠️ Tools Used

- Python & Pandas – for initial data cleaning and quick column-level exploration
- Excel – used to inspect and organize data before dashboarding
- Power BI – for building the final dashboard and visualizing insights

📊 What I Did

- Loaded the raw dataset using Pandas in a Jupyter notebook
- Performed basic cleaning: handled missing values, renamed columns, filtered rows
- Used Excel to inspect column values and structure
- Imported cleaned data into Power BI
- Created visuals to show:
- Sales and profit by category and region
- Monthly sales trends
- Top-performing products
- Profit margin analysis
- Added slicers and filters to make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly

📁 Files Included

- `sales_profit.ipynb` – Python notebook used for data cleaning and exploration
- `sales_profit.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file
- `sales_profit.xls` – Raw dataset used for analysis

🎯 Why This Project Matters

This dashboard is part of my journey as an aspiring data analyst. It reflects my current skills in Python, Pandas, Excel, and Power BI. 
I built it to learn by doing and to showcase my ability to turn raw data into clear business insights.
